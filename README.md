# Aerial

Aerial is a single page, single screen responsive site template. It is a port of [HTML5 UP's Aerial theme](https://html5up.net/aerial). 

## Installation

Run the following commands inside the folder of your Hugo site:

	$ cd themes
	$ git clone https://github.com/sethmacleod/aerial.git

## Getting Started

After installation, you only need to configure the config.toml file and, if desired, change the background picture.

### The config file

Copy the config.toml file from the exampleSite folder into your root folder of your Hugo site. Change the fields as needed. Be sure to change the baseurl. Add or delete social media as needed. You may need to look up the [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon names. The icon field should be filled out without the "fa" prefix. The icon field for Twitter should be `twitter` instead of `fa-twitter`.

### Change the background

Should you choose to change the background, replace the `bg.jpg` file in `themes/aerial/static/css/images`.
